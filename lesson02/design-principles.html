                <p>This is a poor demonstration of Hick's Law. Hick's Law explains that when someone is presented with too many 
                options to choose something, they will get overwhelmed. The reason why it takes so long to choose a show or 
                movie on Netfix is because there are too many options to pick from. </p1>

                <img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="Good example of a Visual Hierarchy">
                <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>

                <p>This is a great visual demonstration of the idea a Visual Hierarchy because it is clearly structured to show 
                    their different products in a clean orderly way. It shows off the most important and new products in a list format, 
                    and then it shows some of the less popular items in a block format. </p2>

                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/" target="_blank">The Avengers Movie</a>
                <p>In this image from the Thor movie, the frame perfctly aligns with the rule of thirds grid that draws the viewer
                    into the movie and allows them to imagine what could happen next.</p3>
